Run db_import.sh on the database server. The script should be run as the
postgres user or with the PGPASSWORD environment variable set to the postgres
user's password so that the database can be set up correctly.

The shp2pgsql command must be in the current PATH.

The following additional environment variables can be set: 
DBNAME=the name of the database (default "naturalearth") 
DBUSER=the owner of the naturalearth database (default "opengeo") 
DBPASS=the password for the owner (default "opengeo78902")

The geoserver_data directory contains a workspace "ne_pg" that should be copied
directly into the GeoServer workspace directory. If the database is not hosted
on the same machine as GeoServer, the store will need configuring to point to
the correct source. Other parameters, such as the user name and password may
also need changing. The setup.sh script should be run in the root data_dir to
ensure that the correct fonts are available.
